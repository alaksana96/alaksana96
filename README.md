### Hi, I'm Aufar Laksana ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software/Machine Learning Engineer currently based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ 

#### Work
I currently work at a startup called **Signal AI**. I'm working on building NLP systems to extract information out of huge amounts of text data for companies to gain insights.

Prior to this, I worked at **JP Morgan**. I did some stuff in E-Trading and Market Data.

#### Interests
My main tech interests are in NLP and Information Retrieval. I'm especially fond of solving problems where machine learning models suffer from massive class imbalances. 

#### Education
I graduated from **Imperial College London** in 2019 with a [MEng. Electronic & Information Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/electrical-engineering-department/electronic-information-meng/). This course was a combination of EE/CS, and I was able to take modules in both the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Department of Computing.
