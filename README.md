### Hi, I'm Aufar Laksana ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer currently based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ 

#### Work
- I currently work at a startup called **Signal AI**. I'm working on building NLP systems to extract information out of data for companies to gain insights.
- I previously worked at **JP Morgan**. I did some stuff in E-Trading and Market Data.

#### Interests
- My main tech interests are in NLP and Information Retrieval.
- I also enjoy working on Robotics and Computer Vision, especially autonomous (flying) vehicles.

- **I'm very interested in the SEA Tech and Startup Scene, and I try to keep up to date with all the new developments back home. I'm always happy to jump on a Zoom Call or go for a Coffee Chat, so feel free to reach out!**

#### Education
- I graduated from **Imperial College London** in 2019 with a [MEng. Electronic & Information Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/electrical-engineering-department/electronic-information-meng/).
  - This course was a combination of EE/CS, and I was able to take modules in both the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and the Department of Computing.
- My Masters project involved Robotics and Augmented Reality. I developed an eye-tracking based navigation system for a powered wheel chair using the Microsoft Hololens, with built in object (person) detection using YOLO for a collision avoidance system.
