### Hi there, I'm Aufar Laksana ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer currently based in London, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ 

I'm Indonesian but I've lived in 5 (and counting!) different countries

I graduated from Imperial College London in 2019 with a MEng. Electronic & Information Engineering. Think of the course as an amalgamation of electronics and computer science.

I previously worked at JP Morgan. I did some stuff in E-Trading and Market Data.

I currently work at a startup called __Signal AI__. I'm working on building NLP systems to extract information out of data for companies to gain insights.
